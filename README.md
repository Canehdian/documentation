# Atlas Documentation

Hello and welcome, please take a look around :)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that this documentation contains some inconsistencies - mainly when it comes to indicating wheter a parameter is required or optional. `<>` is supposed to indicate a required parameter and `[]` an optional one, but that usually isn't the case. All of these issues will be taken care of eventually with the release of VX, please do not go through and pain stakingly fix each little issue of which there are quite a few.
